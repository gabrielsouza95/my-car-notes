# my-car-notes
I this repo, I will develop a simple app to record all basic car operations (gas refueling, oil changes, preventative maintenance, corrective maintenance, etc) and the information associated to it (date, car's km on that note)
## Technologies used
In this project, I will use Django as the back-end and how to store the data on S3, but as I don't have the free tier anymore, I will teach how to but will end using a free alternative to it.
I will probably use a simple react front-end, just because.
